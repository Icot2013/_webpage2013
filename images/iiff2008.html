      <b>Plot summary:</b> Based on a famous novel written by contemporary

      lower middle class family. A lower-middle class family in Bangladesh's 
      capital city of Dhaka is going through hard times. Their father has gone 
      blind and can no longer work, and most of the family's money has been

      problems fall on the shoulder of their beautiful daughter Tithi, who works 
      as a prostitute to help the family. The film is a fairly non-judgmental
